Open Monitor is a nonprofit organization that supports and promotes a free and open Internet, easily accessible by anyone from anywhere. We believe that governments and other entities should not promote or use censorship to control information and ideas - censorship inhibits progress and our collective ability to build a better future for everyone.

We recognize that in exceptional situations, censorship may be necessary to prevent unlawful activities. Yet even in such situations, we believe that censorship must be open, unambiguous, transparent and easily auditable by any Internet citizen.

Open Monitor software is created and shared with the world to help people and organizations around the world to develop and enhance products that support and promote a free and open Internet. We strive to protect and promote openness, not licentiousness. We encourage everyone to use and improve our software for the public good - but please do not use our software to monitor or check sites that promote or display pornography, racism, terrorism or unlawful content or services.
